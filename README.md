## Hello Hackers <img src="https://github.com/sciencepal/sciencepal/blob/master/assets/Hi.gif" width="29px"> 

Azure Hackbook is a guide for developers to learn and build scalable solutions at hackathons on Azure! 

This repo is an inspiration from what I had built perviously with [Arko](https://twitter.com/arkodyutisaha) and you can access that repo here ➡️ [link](https://github.com/arkodyuti/hackathon-hackbook). 

P.S: This repo will keep growing 👍 and I am requesting developers to contribute!

## [Azure for Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/learn/modules/intro-to-docker-containers)

Teams today must release apps quickly to attract and keep business. This requirement forces software development and support teams to always look at solutions that save time and reduces costs. An ideal solution will reduce the time spent on creating and configuring deployment environments, and simplify the software deployment process.

The idea of using software containerization technology as a time-saving and cost reduction solution is popular. One of the strengths of containerization is that you don't have to configure hardware and spend time installing operating systems and software to host a deployment. Containers are isolated from each other and multiple containers can run on the same hardware. This configuration helps us use hardware more efficiently and can help improve our application's security.
